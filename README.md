### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Concepts
* **Language:** Java (Core).
* **Data & Persistence:** SQL (SQLite) and JDBC for robust database integration and data persistence.
* **Architecture:** Interface-agnostic design, Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP), and Factory Patterns.
* **Environment:** Git, Linux/Unix CLI.

### 📚 Learning Now
* **Spring Boot:** Deepening knowledge in the Java ecosystem for web-based enterprise applications.
* **RESTful APIs:** Studying how to expose domain logic via HTTP protocols.
* **Clean Architecture:** Expanding my decoupling skills to layered system designs.

### 🚀 Technical Focus
* **Domain-Driven Logic:** Developing standalone APIs where business rules are encapsulated within service implementations.
* **Decoupled Architecture:** Using the **Dependency Inversion Principle** to ensure the backend can be consumed by multiple delivery layers without side effects.
